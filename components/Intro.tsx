            Because of the nature of this being very opinionated, and there not
            a standard yet, if you want to have your contracts show up here, you
            will have to follow the format uniswap used:
          </Paragraph>
          <Text code>key: chainId</Text>
          <Text code>text: comma separated list of contracts</Text>
          <Paragraph>

                Good on ya. Find the subdomain yourself by going to the ENS app
                and searching for Uniswap.eth (their domain). You&apos;ll know
                if you found the correct address if it has almost two billion in
                UNI token.

                Go visit <Text strong>https://app.ens.domains/ </Text>
                and come back with their deployments subdomain. Hint: it is
                called v3deployments.

          This is a proof-of-concept tool that allows a lookup of <Text italic>verified</Text>{" "}
          contracts on ENS by checking <Text strong>text</Text> records for
          smart contract addresses. We think this is cool because it can help
          users confirm the smart contract addresses they interact with are
          attested by the protocol iteslf.

        <Paragraph>
          This came about because a{" "}
          <a href="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20878">
            Uniswap governance proposal
          </a>{" "}
          aimed to identify <Text italic>official</Text> deployments of the
          protocol across chains.
        </Paragraph>
        <ENSTweet />
        <Paragraph>
          Because there is no standard for this yet, this tool assumes the
          format that Uniswap uses:
        </Paragraph>
        <pre>
          {`
            key:   chain ID
            value: comma separated list of contracts
            `}
        </pre>
        <Paragraph italic>
          Though, there should probably be a standard for this. If you have a
          different format and want to have your contracts show up here or want
          to collaborate on a standard shoot us a DM{" "}
          <a href="https://twitter.com/dApplingNetwork">@dApplingNetwork</a> on
          Twitter.

          Anyway, here it is. We have already entered in the Uniswap ENS name

                Good on ya. Find the subdomain yourself by going to the ENS app
                and searching for Uniswap.eth (their domain).
              </Text>
              <Text>
                Go visit <Text strong>https://app.ens.domains/ </Text>
                and come back with their deployments subdomain. Hint: it is
                called v3deployments. You&apos;ll know if you found the correct
                address if it has almost two billion in UNI token.
